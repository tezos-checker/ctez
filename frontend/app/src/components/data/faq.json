      "question": "How is the value of cTez determined? 🤑",

      "question": " I’ve read something about ‘liquidation’ being possible, what does that mean? 😫",
      "answer": "In the event that you are over or under collateralized by 6.7%, your oven can be closed and anyone can grab the collateral by sending it the outstanding cTez (or fraction thereof)."

      "id": 11,
      "question": "Can I use cTez in any Dapp that uses Tezos? 😏",
      "answer": "Yes, but the developers behind the Dapp must update their smart contracts to work with it. Ex: Any token pair/XTZ, can be replaced by any token pair/cTez."
